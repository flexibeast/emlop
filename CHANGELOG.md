# 0.1 2018-03-07

First release, huzza !

The core commands `list`, `predict`, ans `stats` are here and emlop already feels like a worthy
replacement for genlop (by being faster) or qlop (by having a predict mode and regexp search).

Thanks to singul0 for fixing a panic when outputing to a closed pipe.
