# EMerge LOg Parser

Emlop parses emerge logs (as generated by [portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Portage),
the [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) package manager) to yield useful info like merge history and
merge time prediction. It aims to be a faster, more accurate and more practical replacement of
[genlop](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Perl).

## Installation

Until a proper release is made and an ebuild is writen and added to the main portage tree, follow
these steps to get emlop:

* Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) via portage or [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).
* `cd` into emlop's git repo, and run `cargo install`.
* `cp ~/.cargo/bin/emlop /usr/local/bin` or some other system-wide PATH folder if you wish.

## Basic usage

    # See online help
    emlop -h
    emlop list -h

    # Show merge history and merge times
    emlop list
    emlop l gcc$

    # Show merge statistics
    emlop summary
    emlop s gcc$

    # Predict merge time for current merge
    emerge -rOp | emlop p

Emlop is at an early stage of development. There are plenty of bugs, missing features, and needed
refinements. I'm still rather new to Rust and using this as a learning project.
